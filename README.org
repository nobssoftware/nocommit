* NOCOMMIT and NOMERGE flags

GitHub Action to detect a NOMERGE and a NOCOMMIT flag in your code.

Add those markers anywhere in a comment or in a debug printf to avoid accidentally merging temporary code to production.

Add the following GitHub action:

#+begin_src yaml
on:
  - pull_request

name: Syntax
jobs:
  nocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: "nocommit checker"
        uses: nobssoftware/nocommit@v1
#+end_src

** NOCOMMIT

Use this for code you don’t even wish to commit. Anything you never want to see on CI, e.g. temporary credentials, local dev setup, etc.

You can add a git =pre-commit= hook to help you catch any accidental commits, see the [[pre-commit]] file.

Example:

#+begin_src c
static int
mul(int x, int y)
{
  printf("debug: mul(%d, %d) called", x, y) // NOCOMMIT
  return x * y;
}
#+end_src

** NOMERGE

Same as NOCOMMIT, but it won’t trip up that =pre-commit= hook. Use this for changes you want to push to CI, but not merge to master. This is useful for debugging CI or for testing something on deployed infra.
