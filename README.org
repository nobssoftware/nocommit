* NOCOMMIT and NOMERGE flags

GitHub Action to detect a NOMERGE and a NOCOMMIT flag in your code.

Add those markers anywhere in a comment or in a debug printf to avoid accidentally merging temporary code to production.

Add the following GitHub action:

#+begin_src yaml
on:
  - pull_request

name: Syntax
jobs:
  nocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: "nocommit checker"
        uses: nobssoftware/nocommit@v1
#+end_src
